- How are you?

I'm okay. I saw that mom had that look on her face again, she doesn't like that I'm talking to you.

- Have you read the information booklet?

Yeah... maybe it'll make sense to me when I'm older.

- Have you changed?

What do you mean, changed since when?
- Since the last interview.
What last interview?

- What is your typical day like?

Uh, I go to school, then I do homework, play on the computer and then sleep. Had music class today, hated it. Analyzing sonatas for the seventieth time.

- What are your current worries?

The geography exam is gonna be pretty hard. I studied so much for it, but the teacher's probably gonna ask for like 20 random capitals, nobody can do that! 

- Does the product fit into this time?

It looks good. Not sure how people would use it currently though. Mom wouldn't use it.

- This concludes the second round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.
This [i]actually[/i] was the second round? When was the first one?
