- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Oh, mom told me about you guys. Can't you just make up some responses about how cool I find your stuff?

- You are contractually obliged to answer all questions earnestly.

/ FADE

- How are you?

I'm okay. I saw that mom had that look on her face again, she doesn't like that I'm talking to you.

- Have you read the information booklet?

Yeah... maybe it'll make sense to me when I'm older.

- Have you changed?

What do you mean, changed since when?
- Since the last interview.
What last interview?

- What is your typical day like?

Uh, I go to school, then I do homework, play on the computer and then sleep. Had music class today, hated it. Analyzing sonatas for the seventieth time.

- What are your current worries?

The geography exam is gonna be pretty hard. I studied so much for it, but the teacher's probably gonna ask for like 20 random capitals, nobody can do that! 

- Does the product fit into this time?

It looks good. Not sure how people would use it currently though. Mom wouldn't use it.

- This concludes the second round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.
This [i]actually[/i] was the second round? When was the first one?
- We don't know yet.
What?

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

I wondered when you'd come back. But I was certain you would.

/ FADE

- How are you?

I'm fine. I know what you're doing.

|,nellyChoice1,Aren't you alarmed?,Have you changed?

= nellyChoice1
Should I be? I know the town and us are going down the drain, maybe it's because of you. You're not giving us a lot of confidence.
=
We all have grown a lot closer together, now that we're almost extinct.

/ RATE -15 0
- What's your opinion on the Rift?

My mother told me I shouldn't worry about it.

- What were your thoughts when the survey first started?

There weren't many and they probably weren't too relevant at the time, as you interviewed a literal toddler. My mother didn't speak highly of you, and I wish I trusted her more on this.

|,nellyChoice2,Why haven't you moved somewhere else yet?,Do you plan to move somewhere else?

= nellyChoice2
Are you taunting me?

My mother and Emily really want to leave with me, but I'm not sure I can. What happens when nobody is left anymore?

/ RATE -5 0
- Why didn't you tell friends and family about the product?

Oh sure, Alex and Emily would love to hear more about it.

- This concludes the third round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

I would love if you didn't.

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

A-ha, you are picking up the pace now? I'm afraid it won't do much for you at this point. Do you think that two people entrenched in their opinions about you will give valuable data?

/ FADE

/ RATE -5 5
- How are you?

I've been better, but that is true for all of us now, isn't it? Mom wants to move away more than ever before.
She couldn't bear living here anymore, it festered so much that she left without us.

|,nellyChoice3,How much do you like this survey so far?,If you could only save three personal belongings from a catastrophe: which would you pick?

= nellyChoice3
You will not be surprised that so far, your survey has been disastrous for us and for this town.
=
I like this one. Mary left me something like a self-made weather station in her inheritance. It's solar-powered!
Alex recently gave me one of her old notebooks, full of sketches! She documented a lot of the plant life and rock formations in the area.
And lastly... I would pick a book Alison gave me before she moved away. It is called 'The Dome-Maker's Handbook'.
You might see a pattern there. I'm holding onto anything.

|,nellyChoice4,Why did you choose us?,What is the first thing you would buy after winning the lottery?

= nellyChoice4
We didn't choose you. You chose us, for a reason I don't know yet. We will, I'll make sure of it.
=
...
I would love to move. And help the others moving as well, but I feel that it's not possible, that we have to hold on here forever. I fear what the Rift holds.
Maybe I'd bribe your company to make better surveys and prevent this mess.

- What would you sacrifice for the product?

What are you trying to do? It is obvious that the product does nothing. That it is intended to do nothing.
Now I know why you asked those peculiar questions in the beginning - you want those products to be effectively irrelevant.

|,nellyChoice5,You continue trying despite having no future. Why?,Who are you?

= nellyChoice5
Oh, so you have decided that already? I am glad you are finally showing your true colors.
I'll continue trying to hold the Rift back. Maybe that's what you're after.
=
You know me.

- Are you glad this interview is over?

Only a bit. I enjoy learning from you as well, as you're slowly revealing who you are.

- This concludes the fourth round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

See you.

- What were your thoughts when the survey started?

As soon as you arrived here, everyone had the hunch that the Rift was inevitable. Alison told me how she shuddered when knocked.
Alex has been terrified ever since. Emily went to a dark place and never came back. 

TODO: This on a totally black screen?
- This concludes the last round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We will not meet again.
- This concludes our survey in this town.
