- How are you?

I'm okay. I saw that mom had that look on her face again, she doesn't like that I'm talking to you.

- Have you read the information booklet?

Yeah... maybe it'll make sense to me when I'm older.

- Have you changed?

What do you mean, changed since when?
- Since the last interview.
What last interview?

- What is your typical day like?

Uh, I go to school, then I do homework, play on the computer and then sleep. Had music class today, hated it. Analyzing sonatas for the seventieth time.

- What are your current worries?

The geography exam is gonna be pretty hard. I studied so much for it, but the teacher's probably gonna ask for like 20 random capitals, nobody can do that! 

- Does the product fit into this time?

It looks good. Not sure how people would use it currently though. Mom wouldn't use it.

- This concludes the second round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

I wondered when you'd come back. But I was certain you would.

- What were your thoughts when the survey started?

As soon as you arrived here, everyone had the hunch of the Rift being inevitable. Alison told me how she shuddered when knocked.
Alex has been terrified ever since. Emily went to a dark place and never came back.
