- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Mariana Research? Mom told me about you guys. Can't you just make up some responses about how cool I find your stuff?

- You are contractually obliged to answer all questions earnestly.

Urgh, she said something about her contract extending to her children or something like that, so annoying. Come on in, I guess.

/ FADE

- How are you?

I'm okay. I saw that mom had that look on her face again, she doesn't like that I'm talking to you.
She thought the surveys were over, that's why we moved here in the first place.

- Have you read the information booklet?

Yeah I checked it out a couple of times, but it's just boring. It's on the same level as the wall tattoos mom recently brought here... not the biggest fan to be honest.

- Have you changed?

What do you mean, changed since when?
- Since the last interview.
What last interview? Mom said there was another one a couple years back, but I don't remember you interviewing me.

- What is your typical day like?

Uh, I go to school, then I do homework, play on the computer and then sleep. Had music class today, hated it. Analyzing sonatas for the seventieth time. At least I'll be finishing that up soon, and then it's off to sweet sweet summer holidays.

- What are your current worries?

Mostly short-term things at the moment - upcoming geography exam that nobody thinks they'll pass, my applications getting accepted at the universities, having to stay here forever...
It's alright though, that means I don't have any room to think about things way ahead in the future. That'll change soon enough anyway.

- Does the product fit into this time?

It looks good, but that's about it. Not sure how people would use it currently though. Mom might be a fan of it though, haha! Seems like something she'd bring back randomly after shopping.

- This concludes the second round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.
This [i]actually[/i] was the second round? When was the first one?
- We don't know yet.
What?

# 0

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Oh, hey! I wondered when you'd come back. But I was certain you would.
You haven't changed at all! I probably switched my style about five times since the last interview.

/ FADE

- How are you?

I'm alright, but my mother is getting [i]really[/i] worried now. I would ask you to maybe spare her the interviews, but Emily said you won't even skip the really weird questions.
But hey, maybe in twenty years we'll be able to appeal to your humanity.

|,nellyChoice1,Aren't you alarmed?,Have you changed?

= nellyChoice1
Should I be? I know the town and we are going down the drain, maybe it's because of you. You're not giving us a lot of confidence.
Actually, probably it's because of you.
=
We all have grown a lot closer together, now that we're almost extinct. I've begun an accounting job and now that I handle numbers all day, your product idea and this survey make even less ense.
Just make another dating app or something if you need the money, really.

- What's your opinion on the Rift?

My mom told me I shouldn't worry about it and so I didn't. I actually got curious about it, got closer, tried throwing rocks in there.
It's not really responding to anything, but it doesn't seem like a black hole either. Oh god, if some CERN conspiracy theorists came through here, they would make this into a huge story.
Not that I'm complaining about it might becoming a huge story.

- What were your thoughts when the survey first started?

There weren't many thoughts and they probably weren't too relevant at the time, as you interviewed a literal toddler. My mother didn't speak highly of you, and I didn't understand at the time.
I don't remember much of Alison, but that Mary became... 'unvailable' - is that what you call it? urgh - so unexpectedly really took its toll on me.

|,nellyChoice2,Why haven't you moved somewhere else yet?,Do you plan to move somewhere else?

= nellyChoice2
Wait, do you want us to leave? Why would you want that? We're here for your research, but you already managed to, no better word for it, dispose of two people...
I think leaving now would be a mistake, there's too much to learn about you, St. Mariana and the Rift. And I won't leave before I get some answers.
=
My mother and Emily really want to leave with me, but I'm not sure I can. What happens when nobody is left anymore?
They're scared as much as I am but we're a really strong group and we [i]will[/i] pull through.

If we leave, the Rift might grow way bigger, and where would it stop? At the town borders? Would it eat the whole country? I'm not inclined to try that out yet.

/ RATE -5 0
- Why didn't you tell friends and family about the product?

Oh sure, Alex and Emily would love to hear more about it. Please, for your own sake, just keep it down. Tell your bosses what they wanna hear. Tell them we love the product and your whacky ideas.
Stop being so obedient, please. Treat us as humans for once.

- This concludes the third round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

I would love if you didn't, but I can't stop you.
Yet.

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

A-ha, you are picking up the pace now? I'm afraid it won't do much for you at this point. Do you think that two people entrenched in their opinions about you will give valuable data?

/ FADE

/ RATE -5 5
- How are you?

I've been better, but that is true for all of us now, isn't it? Mom wants to move away more than ever before.
She couldn't bear living here anymore, it festered so much that she left without us.
But honestly? I'm fine. I have a better idea of what you're doing now.

|,nellyChoice3,How much do you like this survey so far?,If you could only save three personal belongings from a catastrophe: which would you pick?

= nellyChoice3
You will not be surprised that so far, your survey has been disastrous for us and for this town.
=
I like this one. Mary left me something like a self-made weather station in her inheritance. It's solar-powered!
Alex recently gave me one of her old notebooks, full of sketches! She documented a lot of the plant life and rock formations in the area.
And lastly... I would pick a book Alison gave me before she moved away. It is called 'The Dome-Maker's Handbook'.
You might see a pattern there. I'm holding onto anything.

|,nellyChoice4,Why did you choose us?,What is the first thing you would buy after winning the lottery?

= nellyChoice4
We didn't choose you. You chose us, for a reason I don't know yet. We will, I'll make sure of it.
=
...
I would love to move. And help the others moving as well, but I feel that it's not possible, that we have to hold on here forever. I fear what the Rift holds.
Maybe I'd bribe your company to make better surveys and prevent this mess.

- What would you sacrifice for the product?

What are you trying to do? It is obvious that the product does nothing. That it is intended to do nothing.
Now I know why you asked those peculiar questions in the beginning - you want those products to be effectively irrelevant.

|,nellyChoice5,You continue trying despite having no future. Why?,Who are you?

= nellyChoice5
Oh, so you have decided that already? I am glad you are finally showing your true colors.
I'll continue trying to hold the Rift back. Maybe that's what you're after.
=
You know me.

- Are you glad this interview is over?

Only a bit. I enjoy learning from you as well, as you're slowly revealing who you are. It's getting funny, almost like a treasure hunt.

- This concludes the fourth round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

See you.

# 20

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Who? -oh, it's you. You look exactly the same, and that makes you even harder to remember! I expect to see at least some gray hair by now.
At the very least, you could put on a wig and some makeup, your company surely has the resources for that!
Did you talk to Emily already? Please, please be more gentle. Alex moved away only a couple of months ago.

/ FADE

- What's your opinion on the Rift?

I'm... intrigued. I thought it might be a portal, but it seems to be just... nothing. I almost got caught by the edge when Alex left - it started expanding so quickly!
You probably already saw that she left - again, please be careful with Emily.

|,nellyChoice6,Is this the end?,What are your current worries?

= nellyChoice6
Oh no. I think you wish it was, but why? Why would you want this town ceasing to exist? That is what I'm asking myself now.
=
Fewer external people come around here to visit, and I cannot fault them - who would want to spend their time in a town with a pulsing wound?
... who would spend their life in such a town...

|,nellyChoice7,Are you alone?,How much would you be willing to spend on the product?

= nellyChoice7
I am not, and you know that. Emily is still with me here, and that's all I need. And all she needs.
=
I spent the majority of my life thinking about it, that is a price few have paid for anything.

|,nellyChoice8,Would you like to sign up for an upcoming survey?,Does the product fit into this time?

= nellyChoice8
I would love to be part of another one, but I'm running out of time. I would guess you already have other surveys running at other towns. Are they falling apart like this one?
You [i]want[/i] this town to disappear, it is clear. And I'll find out why.
=
You could sell it easily nowadays, I guess. For a low price, and I would assume that is your goal: to make unassuming products, but sell them in multiple times?

|,nellyChoice9,Will you make it?,What do you find innovative about the product?

= nellyChoice9
I will absolutely make it. With or without you.
=
This is what you asked already, and what you know already. It's not innovative, it's not meant to be innovative, it's meant to be easily consumable by everyone, regardless of the time.

- A slow wind is creeping across the land. Can you outrun it?

/ RATE 0 -5
I would not want to. It feels like a massive, huge, soothing breeze. Cold, but not freezing. Sometimes, I go out in the night and feel it on my skin, like a kid playing in the rain.
/ RATE 0 -5
Emily does not like it. She does not like the Rift. She does not like when I'm out to feel them. But she stays with me here because of me, and I'm eternally thankful for that.

- This concludes the fifth round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

I have the feeling that it won't be so soon for me...

# 60

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Thank you, I just need to make sure. I felt it when you arrived here, when the darkness crept in. Oh, I'm so glad that Alex chose this as our home so long ago! We're barely at the edge of the Rift.

/ FADE

I wondered when you'd come back. But I was certain you would.

|,nellyChoice10,You continue trying despite having no future. Why?,How are you?

= nellyChoice10
Oh, I'm not trying to live. I just live, despite your hardships. And don't you worry, I have made sure there is a future.
Do you think Emily and I sat here for decades doing nothing? We have talked to people like us, living in the most average towns, having to participate in surveys.
It will not be so easy for you anymore.
=
I'm fine, thank you for asking.

|,nellyChoice11,Why do you have no friends?,Have you read the information booklet?

= nellyChoice11
I wish I had some and I wish Emily was here. But it's not fair - she wasn't a friend, she was much more than that.
=
Oh, it's not in good shape anymore. The pages are wrinkled and yellowed, the pictures faded and dull.

|,nellyChoice12,Is this the end?,Would you tell friends and family about the product?

= nellyChoice12
For you and me both, but in contrast to you, I made sure I have a legacy, something that changes - while you will just get new scripts and follow them forever.
=
Yes. I warned them, to be precise. It's already too late, I know. The product is being sold, but if we manage to stop the surveys it will do much more.

|,nellyChoice13,When will you cry?,Do you think that the product will substantially alter your future?

= nellyChoice13
I cried a lot. When Alison left, when Mary died, when my mother left, when Emily went away. As my mother always said, crying clears the soul - oh Alex, my soul is as clear as day now.
=
If you see it as part of the surveys then sure, haha!

|,nellyChoice14,Have you thought about killing someone?,What is your typical day like?

= nellyChoice14
Oh, what a rude question! Of course I did not! Emily certainly did think about it, not seriously though - it was more of a prolonged 'what if' thought.
=
I feel the edges of the Rift dancing across the ground, I feel the constant wind like the background noise of a busy highway. And I always see you.

|,nellyChoice15,Why aren't you dying?,Does the product fit into this time?

= nellyChoice15
Hey! That is very offensive! Do you think I will give in now, after all that happened? After all we've sacrificed, after all we've achieved?
It has done nothing good for anyone! Even for you, do you think that taking literally a hundred years to dismantle a town this small is efficient? Or 'productive', as you call it?
=
Oh it does, more than ever before. Just like you, it is concerned with everything else except the present.

|,nellyLoop,Why aren't you dying?, Why aren't you dying?
|,nellyLoop,Why aren't you dying?, Why aren't you dying?
|,nellyLoop,Why aren't you dying?, Why aren't you dying?
|,nellyLoop,Why aren't you dying?, Why aren't you dying?
|,nellyLoop,Why aren't you dying?, Why aren't you dying?
|,nellyLoop,Why aren't you dying?, Why aren't you dying?
|,nellyLoop,Why aren't you dying?, Why aren't you dying?
|,nellyLoop,Why aren't you dying?, Why aren't you dying?
|,nellyLoop,Why aren't you dying?, Why aren't you dying?
|,nellyLoop,Why aren't you dying?, Why aren't you dying?

I won't.

- What were your thoughts when the survey started?

As soon as you arrived here, everyone had the hunch that the Rift was inevitable. Alison told me how she shuddered when you knocked.
Alex has been terrified ever since. Emily went to a dark place and never came back. 

/ FADEPARTIAL

- This concludes the last round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We will not meet again.

- This concludes our survey in this town.
