Hiya, uh... sorry, what do you want?

- Good day. We are from the St. Mariana Market Research Division and will conduct a product survey.

You're like... ten years too late for that? Those surveys have stopped coming years ago.

- There simply was no demand. Nevertheless, your contract is still effective.

I guess so... I have to warn you, the interview room is chock-full of boxes and old products and stuff. Come on in.

- How are you?

Fine? Nelly's been taking up a lot of my time.

- Have you read the information booklet?

Glanced over it, thought it was spam. You didn't follow the standard format for it, did you? It's hard to come back to it after such a long time.

- Would you tell friends and family about the product?

Not really, maybe someone would ask about it if I put it somewhere prominent, but that's about it.
And to be honest, if answers on the meta level are allowed, I don't wanna involve anyone with these surveys anymore if it's avoidable.

- Do you think that the product will substantially alter your future?

I don't think so. I only experienced a couple of interviews with similar questions before, but I'm glad they didn't have any effect on me.

- What is your typical day like?

You can see it right in front of you. Half of it is Nelly, one quarter of it is Nelly again, the rest of it is sleep. Sometimes.

- Does the product fit into this time?

Huh? It's on the modern side, but not that it's out of place. Probably something you would find in the background of a new home technology ad.

Oh. Oh, wow. Didn't think you'd get back here.

Nelly told me you already visited her? WHY? Please, just can't you go away? What are you doing?

Come in, quickly before Nelly sees you. Why did you even talk to her last time?
At least she doesn't remember you.

- How are you?

Alright. The mood is down a bit since Alison left - I hope you didn't leave a super negative impression with her. She didn't speak fondly of you.

- Have you read the information booklet?

Gave it a proper read this time, but it makes less sense the further I got. You will spend decades on this?

- Have you changed?

I hope not.

- What is your typical day like?

I took up my work at the pharmacy again, so it's that for the first half of the day and then it's your usual household routine.
I used to chat with Alison in the evenings. I could call her, or drive to her care home, but it doesn't feel right - like the conversations were always meant to be short, at a transient space.

- What are your current worries?

I worry about the town. And about Nelly.

- Does the product fit into this time?

More now than last time you asked. Still, looks more like something on the cover of a tech magazine.

- This concludes the second round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

Eh...
