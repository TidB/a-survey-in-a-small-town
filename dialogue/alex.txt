Hiya, uh... sorry, what do you want?

- Good day. We are from the St. Mariana Market Research Division and will conduct a product survey.

You're like... ten years too late for that? Those surveys have stopped coming years ago.

- There simply was no demand. Nevertheless, your contract is still effective.

I guess so... I have to warn you, the interview room is chock-full of boxes and old products and stuff. Come on in.

- How are you?

Fine? Nelly's been taking up a lot of my time.

- Have you read the information booklet?

Glanced over it, thought it was spam. You didn't follow the standard format for it, did you? It's hard to come back to it after such a long time.

- Would you tell friends and family about the product?

Not really, maybe someone would ask about it if I put it somewhere prominent, but that's about it.
And to be honest, if answers on the meta level are allowed, I don't wanna involve anyone with these surveys anymore if it's avoidable.

- Do you think that the product will substantially alter your future?

I don't think so. I only experienced a couple of interviews with similar questions before, but I'm glad they didn't have any effect on me.

- What is your typical day like?

You can see it right in front of you. Half of it is Nelly, one quarter of it is Nelly again, the rest of it is sleep. Sometimes.

- Does the product fit into this time?

Huh? It's on the modern side, but not that it's out of place. Probably something you would find in the background of a new home technology ad.

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Oh. Oh, wow. Didn't think you'd get back here.

Come in, quickly before Nelly sees you. Why did you even talk to her last time?
At least she doesn't remember you.
=
Nelly told me you already visited her? WHY? Please, just can't you go away? What are you doing?

- How are you?

= -25nellyVisitedBeforeAlex
Alright. The mood is down a bit since Alison left - I hope you didn't leave a super negative impression with her. She didn't speak fondly of you.
=
Worse since you arrived. Do you have no empathy? Do you just read everything off your script?

- Have you read the information booklet?

Gave it a proper read this time, but it makes less sense the further I got. You will spend decades on this?

- Have you changed?

I hope not.

- What is your typical day like?

I took up my work at the pharmacy again, so it's that for the first half of the day and then it's your usual household routine.
I used to chat with Alison in the evenings. I could call her, or drive to her care home, but it doesn't feel right - like the conversations were always meant to be transient.

- What are your current worries?

I worry about the town. And about Nelly.

- Does the product fit into this time?

More now than last time you asked. Still, looks more like something on the cover of a tech magazine.

- This concludes the second round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

Eh...

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Oh no.

- You are contractually obliged to partake in the interviews.

Then I'm consciously obliged to give you rubbish data.

- How are you?

Take a guess.

- You have to answer the question. How are you?

I've been anxious for all these years for you to arrive again, and now that you're here I'm almost relaxed.

|,alexChoice1,Aren't you alarmed?,Have you changed?

= alexChoice1
What kind of question is this? So you [i]are[/i] aware of the damage you're doing?
=
I've grown weary.

- What's your opinion on the Rift?

It's not looking good. It coincided with Mary's passing. If you manage to scare more people away, I'm sure it will overgrow.

- What were your thoughts when the survey first started?

I feared it, and I was right. With the surveys eventually stopping, I thought it was a good place to raise Nelly, but I was wrong. You came back.

|,alexChoice2,Why haven't you moved somewhere else yet?,Do you plan to move somewhere else?

= alexChoice2
I would, if I could. I thought I could protect Nelly from you, but I couldn't. And I don't want to risk tearing the Rift deeper. It seems to grow when fewer people are there.
=
I do. This town is devouring people. At least nobody is moving here, like they used to.

- Why didn't you tell friends and family about the product?

Are you again trying to shame me?
- You have to answer the question.
Absolutely no reason to tell anyone about it.

- This concludes the third round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

Sure. I need to talk with Nelly.

[i]This[/i] early again? Oh well, you managed to catch me another time after all.

- How are you?

Worse than before, but at least it didn't happen as much as last time. The folks are still here, the Rift grew only a tiny amount.

|,alexChoice3,How much do you like this survey so far?,If you could only save three personal belongings from a catastrophe, which would you pick?

= alexChoice3
Is this a joke? This is the only survey I have ever been part of, and it has been the absolute worst.
=
Oh, there isn't much I have here anyway. I like this rocking chair - I sound really old when I say that - and my current fountain pen. Oh, that sounds even older.
The third one would probably be a deck of cards I have owned for decades by now. Oh, so many memories of evenings in our small group in the living room.

|,alexChoice4,Why did you choose us?,What is the first thing you would buy after winning the lottery?

= alexChoice4
Did we? I mean kind of, since we live here, but what kind of answer do you expect? Or did you write this question with a competition of more surveys in mind?
=
Get away from here? Does this answer count? I mean we're leaving anyway, but the money would certainly help with that.

- What would you sacrifice for the product?

You're not making much sense to me, I'm afraid. Nothing is the best I can come up with, but you seem to expect that already.
You're successful in making the most irrelevant product in history, so I can only guess it is some kind of strategy.

|,alexChoice5,You continue trying despite having no future. Why?,Who are you?

= alexChoice5
Oh, does it look like I'm trying? Does it look like I'm trying to hang on here? Just barely.
=
I'm Alex, and soon I'm somewhere else.

- Are you glad this interview is over?

Not at all. I would have found it okay if you stuck with the longer pauses between interviews.

- This concludes the fourth round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

Leave and never come back. I won't be here on your next round.
