Hiya, uh... sorry, what do you want?

- Good day. We are from the St. Mariana Market Research Division and will conduct a product survey.

You're like... ten years too late for that? Those surveys have stopped coming years ago.

- There simply was no demand. Nevertheless, your contract is still effective.

I guess so... I have to warn you, the interview room is chock-full of boxes and old products and stuff. Come on in.

- How are you?

Fine? Nelly's been taking up a lot of my time.

- Have you read the information booklet?

Glanced over it, thought it was spam. You didn't follow the standard format for it, did you? It's hard to come back to it after such a long time.

- Would you tell friends and family about the product?

Not really, maybe someone would ask about it if I put it somewhere prominent, but that's about it.
And to be honest, if answers on the meta level are allowed, I don't wanna involve anyone with these surveys anymore if it's avoidable.

- Do you think that the product will substantially alter your future?

I don't think so. I only experienced a couple of interviews with similar questions before, but I'm glad they didn't have any effect on me.

- What is your typical day like?

You can see it right in front of you. Half of it is Nelly, one quarter of it is Nelly again, the rest of it is sleep. Sometimes.

- Does the product fit into this time?

Huh? It's on the modern side, but not that it's out of place. Probably something you would find in the background of a new home technology ad.
