- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and will conduct a product survey.

Aw crap...
I hope this won't take too long? Kinda busy with uni work right now...

- Have you read the information booklet?

Kinda? I didn't really get it, this seems like a lot of effort for a pretty uninteresting product.

- As mentioned in the booklet, we will conduct multiple surveys over the next decades with the same product.
- We hope to meet you again soon.

Nice talking to you, I guess I can spare a few minutes over a lifetime after all.

I've tutored Nelly for a while, apart from that I'm glad that I'm not too attached to this town...

Wait, you're telling me that a century-long survey only takes a couple hours from your point of view?
Do you have [i]any[/i] idea what you're doing? How it affects us?
