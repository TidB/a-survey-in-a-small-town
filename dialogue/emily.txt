- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and will conduct a product survey.

Aw crap...
I hope this won't take too long? Kinda busy with uni work right now...

/ FADE

- How are you?

I'm fine.

- Have you read the information booklet?

Kinda? I didn't really get it, this seems like a lot of effort for a pretty uninteresting product.

- Would you tell friends and family about the product?

Yeah, no. The only people recommending those things to each other are fourty-year-old moms spending all their time at home.

- Do you think that the product will substantially alter your future?

I hope not.

- What is your typical day like?

Learning. At least the benefits are good enough here so I don't have to wait tables.

- Does the product fit into this time?

I like it. Maybe a bit too cool currently, it would attract attention I wouldn't want.

- As mentioned in the booklet, we will conduct multiple surveys over the next decades with the same product.
- We hope to meet you again soon.

Yeah sure. Hopefully not during the exam period because you'll get even shorter answers.

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Oooh hey, it's you again. You... look exactly the same, that's cool.

- How are you?

I'm fine. 

- Have you read the information booklet?

I think I flipped through it on a very boring day, yes. 

- Have you changed?

I'm glad I did - uni's done, work's good, I think I'm happier now. Made some new friends.

- What is your typical day like?

Your usual adult day, y'know. Sleeping, working, living, sleeping. The 'living' part usually being eating and going out.
Oh, I sometimes tutor Nelly, but that's less frequent than a few years ago. 

- What are your current worries?

I found some kind of routine with work and meeting friends, but I fear that this will continue forever. Obviously I'm happy, but the urge to wanna break out of it is always there.
I'm still having so much fun with Nelly though. Apart from her, I'm glad that I'm not too attached to this town...
On that point, please be careful with your interview - I heard that Alison moved away earlier than expected because of the first interview round?

- Does the product fit into this time?

I think it looks better now, but more suited for someone half my age.

- This concludes the second round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

Nice talking to you, I guess I can spare a few minutes over a lifetime after all.

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Wha- ...oh. We're still doing this? Almost thought it was over already. I have to ask now - is this something like a meta experiment?
You look like you haven't aged at all, is this an elaborate trick?

- As you surely have noticed, the ongoing development of time-travelling devices has now permitted external researchers to be aided in cutting-edge technologies. As such, St. Mariana has adopted them as a tool to aid in market research.

Wait, you're telling me that a century-long survey only takes a couple hours from your point of view? This is your [i]average[/i] work day?
Do you have [i]any[/i] idea what you're doing? How it affects us?

- How are you?

Ah, I'm getting worried. Since Mary died a couple of years ago, a rift has started to open. Nelly talked about how it's caused by the town losing its people.
I'm worried about her.

= emilyChoice1
What? Yes, I'm getting more alarmed by the day - and now you show up again? You're just making everything worse.
=
Not for the better.

/ RATE -15 0
- What's your opinion on the Rift?

There's no opinion to be had. Do you ask people for opinions on earthquakes? I'll stay here.

- What were your thoughts when the survey first started?

I didn't think it was too bad - I thought the surveys were over and the benefits were good. When you started visiting, it wasn't too bad either.
What I didn't anticipate was how destructive you are.

|,emilyChoice2,Why haven't you moved somewhere else yet?,Do you plan to move somewhere else?

= emilyChoice2
Oh please, you don't have to be condescending about it.

Maybe. I've looked at other options, while Nelly wants to stay here. And I don't want to lose her to this town alone.

- Why didn't you tell friends and family about the product?

Are you surveying my family too? What the hell? Of course I didn't, not to a bunch of creeps.

- This concludes the third round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

Hm-hmm.
