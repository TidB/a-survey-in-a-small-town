- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and will conduct a product survey.

Aw crap...
I hope this won't take too long? Kinda busy with uni work right now...

/ FADE

- How are you?

I'm fine.

- Have you read the information booklet?

Kinda? I didn't really get it, this seems like a lot of effort for a pretty uninteresting product.

- Would you tell friends and family about the product?

Yeah, no. The only people recommending those things to each other are fourty-year-old moms spending all their time at home.

- Do you think that the product will substantially alter your future?

I hope not.

- What is your typical day like?

Learning. At least the benefits are good enough here so I don't have to wait tables.

- Does the product fit into this time?

I like it. Maybe a bit too cool currently, it would attract attention I wouldn't want.

- As mentioned in the booklet, we will conduct multiple surveys over the next decades with the same product.
- We hope to meet you again soon.

Yeah sure. Hopefully not during the exam period because you'll get even shorter answers.

I've tutored Nelly for a while, apart from that I'm glad that I'm not too attached to this town...

Nice talking to you, I guess I can spare a few minutes over a lifetime after all.

Wait, you're telling me that a century-long survey only takes a couple hours from your point of view?
Do you have [i]any[/i] idea what you're doing? How it affects us?
