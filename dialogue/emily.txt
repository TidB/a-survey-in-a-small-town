- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and will conduct a product survey.

Aw crap, I hope Alex didn't lie to me. She said the surveys were over...
I hope this won't take too long? Kinda busy with uni work right now...

RATE -5 0
- Do not worry. The survey will only take a few hours or a few decades, depending on your point of view.

Is that a joke? C'mon, let's get this over with.

/ FADE

- How are you?

I'm fine, I guess. Moved here only a couple of weeks ago, so I'm still settling in. I've been a bit reluctant about living in a small town since that means you gotta talk a lot to your neighbors and invite them over to dinner and whatever, but it's been fine so far.
The folks are really nice here, so I don't miss the more anonymous cities that much. Except for the convenience of having to drive half an hour to get groceries, I guess.

- Have you read the information booklet?

Kinda? I didn't really get it, this seems like a lot of effort for a pretty uninteresting product.

- Would you tell friends and family about the product?

Yeah, no. The only people recommending those things to each other are fourty-year-old moms spending all their time at home.
Whoops, I hope Alex didn't hear this.

- Do you think that the product will substantially alter your future?

I hope not. I have a very rough plan of what I wanna do, and wouldn't like changing it now.
But it really doesn't seem interesting - sorry - so I'm not worrying about it.

- What is your typical day like?

Learning. At least the benefits in this town are good enough here so I don't have to wait tables, studying Maths is hard enough already.
Speaking of benefits, I wonder why the government is still subsidizing this town when barely any surveys are made here. I guess it's just not been on their minds at all, and I like to keep it that way.

- Does the product fit into this time?

I like it. Maybe a bit too cool currently, it would attract attention I wouldn't want.

- As mentioned in the booklet, we will conduct multiple surveys over the next decades with the same product.
/ RATE -5 0
- We hope to meet you again soon.

[i]Decades[/i]?! Jesus christ, alrighty then.
Just not too soon please, if you do it during the exam period you'll get even shorter answers.

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Mariner? Oooh hey, it's you again. You... look exactly the same, that's cool.

/ FADE

- How are you?

I'm fine. 

- Have you read the information booklet?

I think I flipped through it on a very boring day, yes. But in all honesty, what are you trying to do?
There's no actual vision, not even something fancy marketing talk, 

- Have you changed?

I'm glad I did - uni's done, work's good, I think I'm happier now. Made some new friends.

- What is your typical day like?

Your usual adult day, y'know. Sleeping, working, living, sleeping. The 'living' part usually being eating and going out.
Oh, I sometimes tutor Nelly, but that's less frequent than a few years ago. 

- What are your current worries?

I found some kind of routine with work and meeting friends, but I fear that this will continue forever. Obviously I'm happy, but the urge to wanna break out of it is always there.
I'm still having so much fun with Nelly though. Apart from her, I'm glad that I'm not too attached to this town...
On that point, please be careful with your interview - I heard that Alison moved away earlier than expected because of the first interview round?

- Does the product fit into this time?

I think it looks better now, but more suited for someone half my age.

- This concludes the second round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

Nice talking to you, I guess I can spare a few minutes over a lifetime after all.

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Wha- ...oh. We're still doing this? Almost thought it was over already. I have to ask now - is this something like a meta experiment?
You look like you haven't aged at all, is this an elaborate trick?

- As you surely have noticed, the ongoing development of time-travelling devices has now permitted external researchers to be aided in cutting-edge technologies.
- As such, St. Mariana spearheads the current efforts of adopting them as the next revolution in market research.

Wait, you're telling me that a century-long survey only takes a couple hours from your point of view? This is your [i]average[/i] work day?
Do you have [i]any[/i] idea what you're doing? How it affects us? Urgh, why do researches always treat everything like lab rats? Why do the ytreat lab rats like lab rats?

/ FADE

- How are you?

Ah, I'm getting worried. Since Mary died a couple of years ago, a rift has started to open. Nelly talked about how it's caused by the town losing its people.
I'm worried about her.

|,emilyChoice1,Aren't you alarmed?,Have you changed?

= emilyChoice1
What? Yes, I'm getting more alarmed by the day - and now you show up again? You're just making everything worse.
=
Not for the better.

/ RATE -15 0
- What's your opinion on the Rift?

There's no opinion to be had. Do you ask people for opinions on earthquakes? I'll stay here.

- What were your thoughts when the survey first started?

I didn't think it was too bad - I thought the surveys were over and the benefits were good. When you started visiting, it wasn't too bad either.
What I didn't anticipate was how destructive you are.

|,emilyChoice2,Why haven't you moved somewhere else yet?,Do you plan to move somewhere else?

= emilyChoice2
Oh please, you don't have to be condescending about it. 
=
Maybe. I've looked at other options, while Nelly wants to stay here. And I don't want to lose her to this town.

/ RATE -5 0
- Why didn't you tell friends and family about the product?

Are you surveying my family too? What the hell? Of course I didn't, not to a bunch of creeps.

- This concludes the third round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

Hm-hmm.

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Oh no, already? You're speeding up [i]now[/i] of all times? You should've done that when people were still living here and you couldn't scare them away that quickly.

/ RATE -5 5
- How are you?

The Rift seems to have stabilized for now, I guess because nobody left in the meantime. The Wind is growing stronger now.
Sometimes, I don't want to go buy groceries. It feels like I'm giving the Rift an opportunity to grow again.

|,emilyChoice3,How much do you like this survey so far?,If you could only save three personal belongings from a catastrophe: which would you pick?

= emilyChoice3
That is a [i]bold[/i] question. Wow. Do you have 'Caused half the town to die or leave' as an option?
- Please answer the question.
I don't like it. Zero out of ten.
=
Is this another warning? Anyway, I'd pick my guitar, my diploma and... hm, I'm not sure. Despite all this, maybe a map of this town.
When I moved in, they gave me some maps and documents and whatnot, and among those was a map of... better times, I assume. 

|,emilyChoice4,Why did you choose us?,What is the first thing you would buy after winning the lottery?

= emilyChoice4
Haha! Wow, it's getting better and better. Or worse and worse. Your pick. To answer your question, nobody chose you.
You came here by yourselves, why don't you ask your boss?
=
A house in another town.

/ RATE -5 0
- What would you sacrifice for the product?

= emilyChoice4
Yeah, it [i]is[/i] getting worse and worse.
=

I don't think I'd sacrifice anything beyond catching it when it's thrown around for free at some point.

|,emilyChoice5,You continue trying despite having no future. Why?,Who are you?

= emilyChoice5
What?
=
I'm... Emily? Sorry if you hoped for an introspective moody answer, I don't give those.

- Are you glad this interview is over?

I sure am, but it'll just be replaced by the worry of when you'll come back.

- This concludes the fourth round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

I hope not.

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Hm. I almost wish you sticked to the faster schedule instead.

/ FADE

- What's your opinion on the Rift?

It's frighteningly big now, it's almost making me sick. I sometimes catch myself staring at it for an hour. The Wind got stronger as well, it's colder and darker than anything else I've felt before. 

|,emilyChoice6,Is this the end?,What are your current worries?

= emilyChoice6
I'm pretty sure you know the answer to this already. That's what the survey is about, isn't it? You can tell me now, but you won't.
I don't think this is the end. Nelly is too strong.
=
There's not much left to worry about. Just us and the town.

|,emilyChoice7,Are you alone?,How much would you be willing to spend on the product?

= emilyChoice7
Oh, you could've asked that in a nicer way! Nelly and I are still together here!
=
Nothing. You should give the customers money for spending time on this.

|,emilyChoice8,Would you like to sign up for an upcoming survey?,Does the product fit into this time?

= emilyChoice8
Oh, you're getting sassy. I would never agree with that. And I know that because I can't remember any other time-travelling surveys in the past, haha!
=
Was this question just a distraction the whole time? Why do you ask this at points decades apart, while trends come and go very quickly. And this doesn't fit.
I think you missed the point entirely, but by now... I think you know why you're asking it, and when.

|,emilyChoice9,Will you make it?,What do you find innovative about the product?

= emilyChoice9
Oh, I will. Don't you worry.
=
This survey. I have never seen a grander example of exceptional technology used for - well, monetary profit. You're not interested in changing the world, are you?
You're interested in not changing the world too much. To preserve the continuity of time.

- A slow wind is creeping across the land. Can you outrun it?

Oh I can't, but I don't need to. But I'm happy to hear that you feel it as well. May you feel it forever.

- This concludes the fifth round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

Please die.
