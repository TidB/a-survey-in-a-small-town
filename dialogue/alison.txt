Oooh, I did not expect to do another interview. This is so nice of you!

- Good day. We are from the St. Mariana Market Research Division and -

Yes, yes, come in and take your seats!

/ FADE

- Have you read the information booklet?

Yes! The product is so adorable, my granddaughter would love it!

- Do you think that the product will substantially alter your future?

Ha, I'm afraid it's not [i]that[/i] adorable. I think that is not your intention, is it?

- Do you think that the product fits into this time?

Oh my, your questions surely are of the stranger kind.
I find it a bit too modern for my taste - but everything in the electronics store looks too modern for me, ha ha ha!

- As you noticed in the booklet, we will conduct multiple surveys over the next decades with the same product.
- We hope to meet you again soon.

Decades? My oh my, you really [i]are[/i] late to all this! My old bones won't make it that far, I tell you!
