Oooh, I did not expect to do another interview. This is so nice of you!

- Good day. We are from the St. Mariana Market Research Division and -

Yes, yes, come in and take your seats!

/ FADE

- Have you read the information booklet?

Yes! The product is so adorable, my granddaughter would love it!

- Do you think that the product will substantially alter your future?

Ha, I'm afraid it's not [i]that[/i] adorable. I think that is not your intention, is it?

- Do you think that the product fits into this time?

Oh my, your questions surely are of the stranger kind.
I find it a bit too modern for my taste - but everything in the electronics store looks too modern for me, ha ha ha!

Last time I went in there, they had these weird toasters with [i]FIVE[/i] slots, can you imagine that? Back in [i]my[/i] days, we didn't have these fancy things - we ate the bread raw! We could not spare the extra energy for it! Then again, it was the [i]good[/i] bread from the nearby farm, Mellingburg's. What a wonderful family, so lovely! We attended their wedding, they rented the biggest barn in the whole state! They were such a cute couple! Have you heard of them? Anyway, they made great bread, whole grain and not the cheap kind you see in the supermarkets! A real let down, I tell you! Too bad they had to close down when the inspectors came around, they have no idea what bread should taste like! It all is just a conspiracy of BIG GRAIN, and I am the only person to see it yet!

I talked about it with Natalie, you might know her if you drove here through the north route (such bad traffic!) and stopped by the diner just outside, the bread they have there is wonderful too! But still, she did not see how she is being manipulated, almost puppeteered! You know what, before you leave you should definitely stop by here again, I will prepare you the best sandwiches you will ever have tasted! True full grain!
Do you like lettuce? I hope you do, because I always and only use a combination of four different lettuces for my sandwiches. Most people do not even realize that lettuces have flavors! They just look at the textures and colors and think that is all! There is a whole [i]dimension[/i] the people cannot even [i]fathom[/i] and yet they remain ignorant! This is a charged topic for many, yet I don't understand why!

- As you noticed in the booklet, we will conduct multiple surveys over the next decades with the same product.
- We hope to meet you again soon.

Decades? My oh my, you really [i]are[/i] late to all this! My old bones won't make it that far, I tell you!
