- Good day. We are from the St. Mariana Market Research Division and will conduct a product survey.

A-ha-ha! Never thought you kinda people would come around here again!

/ FADE

- How are you?

Certainly better now, ha-ha-ha! Can't believe you're back here again, doing the old thing!

- Have you read the information booklet?

I sure have! Not too impressed so far, but maybe you have a couple surprises planned for me, ha ha ha!
Y'know, we've seen all kinds of weird things here. Most of them total rubbish of course, but some were pretty incredible or terrifying. Or both.
This one seems to be a bit [i]too[i] ordinary, especially considering the amount of work you guys are putting in. What's going on there?

- Would you tell friends and family about the product?

Nah, this one didn't win me over - yet. You gotta earn it around here, ha! Anyhow, I guess my family's already pretty annoyed of me blabbering about this stuff all these years.

- Do you think that the product will substantially alter your future?

What? I gotta level with you, that seems like a pretty arrogant question. A lot of things were completely useless, garbage now being thrown at people who actually pay for them.
Again, is that your goal? Do you [i]want[/i] to sell mundane products?

- What is your typical day like?

Oh god, that's the experience I didn't want to have relive with the surveys - talking about this one makes me more depressed each time. You know the drill, get up at seven, get to work, be bored for eight hours, consume media for three hours interrupted by chores and then go to bed.
If you asked me a couple of years back, then you'd obviously have the other interviews as well. Radio silence on that end though. Not that I'm complaining, but it's a break from the routine.

- Does the product fit into this time?

Ah, do your marketing guys think that it's just 'too advanced' for this time? Looks-wise, probably more modern than anything else I can recall seeing, but it's not necessarily a bad thing.
The future doesn't start everywhere at once, someone has to make the first step.

- This concludes the first round of interview. As mentioned in the booklet, we will conduct multiple surveys over the next decades with the same product.
- Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

Oh god, you guys really [i]are[/i] confident in your product, huh? Haven't seen that level of dedication in decades, back when Miller's tried researching their new anti-slip driveway powder!

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Ah you're back! I almost thought you were just teasing us for such a long time!

- How are you?

I'm good, thanks for asking!

- Have you read the information booklet?

Ha, you bet I refreshed my mind on that! Can't say much has changed since then.

- Have you changed?

More tired, if anything! I wasn't the youngest at our last meeting and I can't say it got better, ha!

- What is your typical day like?

...
The same as always. I wish you kinda people would come here more often again. It's been years since the biggest wave ended, and now it's just you guys showing up less often than my overseas shopping orders, ha!

- What are your current worries?

Oh, these questions! You're gonna make me tear up, in a good way!
It's currently just the fear of not being able to break out of this loop until I die. 

- Does the product fit into this time?

That question again, I was waiting for it! Well, take my last answer and put it 15 years into the future, ha! That's how it looks!

- This concludes the second round of interviews. Thank you for your participation. We hope to meet you again soon.

Already over? Aw no, I would've hoped for a couple more hours, ha-ha-ha!
Until next time!
