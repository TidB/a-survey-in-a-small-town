- Good day. We are from the St. Mariana Market Research Division and will conduct a product survey.

A-ha-ha! Never thought you kinda people would come around here again!

/ FADE

- How are you?

Certainly better now, ha-ha-ha! Can't believe you're back here again, doing the old thing!

- Have you read the information booklet?

I sure have! Not too impressed so far, but maybe you have a couple surprises planned for me, ha ha ha! 

- Would you tell friends and family about the product?

Nah, this one didn't win me over - yet. You gotta earn it around here, ha!

- Do you think that the product will substantially alter your future?

What? I gotta level with you, that seems like a pretty arrogant question.

- What does your typical day look like?

Oh god, that's the experience I didn't want to have relive with the surveys - talking about this one makes me more depressed each time. You know the drill, get up at seven, get to work, be bored for eight hours, consume media for three hours interrupted by chores and then go to bed.

- Does the product fit into this time?

- Good day. We are from the [i]St. Mariana Market Research Division[/i] and are continuing our product survey.

Ah you're back! I almost thought you were just teasing us for such a long time!

- How are you?



- Have you read the information booklet?

Ha, you bet I refreshed my mind on that! Can't say much has changed since then.
